the basic fucntion of API testing is to check the functionality,performance reliability and security of the interfaces.
An API is different from UI as it basically deals with the actual logic of the programming interface rather than dealing with the graphics or look and feel of the program.
An API Generated a communication and data exchange path between two different software systems.
An API defines requests and how requests can be made and the different data forms that can be used.
It incloves two steps,one is to set up a toll to drive an API and the other is to write the code to test for the API
its output can include any type of data or a true false return say pass or fail and a call to another function as well.
